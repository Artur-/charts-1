Vaadin Charts ${project.version}
===========================

This is a beta level build of the Vaadin Charts add-on. Vaadin Charts is based on
popular Highcharts ${highcharts.version} JavaScript library. Vaadin Charts also 
includes the previously separate Vaadin Timeline add-on, which uses the HTML5 
canvas for drawing.

This version is built against Vaadin ${vaadin.version.maven}.

Installation
============
Vaadin Charts is a standard Vaadin Add-on package. To use it, drag the jar file 
in this package (and required dependencies) to your project or use the following
maven module:

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.vaadin.addon</groupId>
	<artifactId>vaadin-charts</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>

You your project also needs to have Vaadin Add-ons repository defined:

<repository>
	<id>vaadin-addons</id>
	<url>http://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>

The project also requires the Apache 2 licensed libraries: gson and commons-io 
library. Dependencies are defined in the pom.xml and will be automatically 
resolved for Maven users. All required libraries, except those required by core
Vaadin itself, are also collected to the lib directory for developers not using 
a modern build system.

Note, that the package also has client side extensions, so make sure that you
compile your widgetset after installation!
