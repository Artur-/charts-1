Vaadin Charts ${project.version}
===========================

This is a preliminary build of the Vaadin Charts add-on. Vaadin Charts is based on
Highcharts ${highcharts.version}. Vaadin Charts also includes the previously separate 
Vaadin Timeline add-on, which uses the HTML5 canvas for drawing.

This version is built against Vaadin ${vaadin.version.maven}.

Installation
============
Vaadin Charts is a standard Vaadin Add-on package. At its current development
status it is offered only under the CVAL license for Vaadin Pro Account customers.
To use it, drag the jar file in this package to your project or use the following
maven module:

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.vaadin.addon</groupId>
	<artifactId>vaadin-charts</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>

The project also requires the Apache 2 licensed Gson library. Dependencies 
are defined in the pom.xml and will be automatically resolved for Maven users. 
All required libraries are also collected in the lib directory.

Note, that the package also has client side extensions, so make sure that you
compile your widgetset after installation!
