Vaadin Chart Exporting demo
===========================

This example demonstrates how Vaadin Charts can by used also on the server 
side - naturally with the same clean Java API.

Before using this method, PhantomJS needs to be installed from phantomjs.org. 
Install it into your PATH or provide its location as a system property for 
the server.

Then demo can then be run by issuing following command.
mvn jetty:run-war
