<p>As you might have noticed, Vaadin Chart and the under embedded
	Highcharts library support buttons via the chart can be downloaded in
	various file formats or printed. In real life this approach is bit
	naive feature. If the user wishes to print the document, he/she
	probably just uses the browsers default print feature and prints the
	whole document. And if the chart should be re-used, it most likely
	happens in the very same application on the server side - not in end
	users device.</p>
</p>

<p>
	Although the chart rendering happens using JavaScript in the browser,
	modern web technologies also make it possible to use the exact same
	chart image on the server side - e.g. to create PDF reports. Vaadin
	Charts contains a helper that uses <a href="http://phantomjs.org/"></a>PhantomJS</a>
	tool in your server to render the chart into SVG. From SVG onwards,
	practically everything is possible with cool tools like <a
		href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">Batik SVG Toolkit</a> and
	countless Java document handling libraries. The setup is closely
	related to Highcharts very own export server, which can also be used
	with Vaadin Charts.
</p>
<p>As an example you can try SVG and PDF buttons. In both of them
	the chart on this page is first rendered into SVG format using the
	built-in helper in Vaadin Charts. The SVG button downloads the raw SVG
	as a file, the PDF button further uses iText library to embed it into
	PDF file.</p>
