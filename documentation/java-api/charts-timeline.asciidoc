[[charts.timeline]]
= Timeline

You can enable a timeline in a chart that displays one or more time series.
The timeline allows selecting different time ranges for which to display the chart data,
as well as navigating between such ranges. It is especially useful when working with large time series.
Adding a timeline to your chart is very easy - just set the 'timeline' property to 'true',
that is, call chart.setTimeline(true). If you have multiple series, the first one is presented on
a timeline. In a timeline, the X values of the data sets should be of the type [classname]#Date#.
Also integer values can be used, in which case they are interpreted as milliseconds since the 01/01/1970 epoch.
Timeline is supported in the following chart types: area, arearange, areaspline,
 areasplinerange, bar, canndlestick, column, columnrange, line, ohlc, polygon,
 scatter, and spline.

Adding the timeline to a Vaadin chart allows selecting a time range
in the chart, and also to zoom into and out of the data.
You can change the time range using the navigator at the bottom of the chart.

Another way to change the time range is to use the range selector. The range selector includes
a set of predefined time ranges for easier navigation, for example 1, month, 3 month, 6 month etc. To specify a custom time range, you can
use range selector text fields for setting start and end of the time interval.

You can configure the range navigator and selector in the chart configuration.
For example, you can change the style of the range selector buttons.

[source, java]
----
RangeSelector rangeSelector = new RangeSelector();
ButtonTheme theme = new ButtonTheme();
Style style = new Style();
style.setColor(new SolidColor("#0766d8"));
style.setFontWeight(FontWeight.BOLD);
theme.setStyle(style);
rangeSelector.setButtonTheme(theme);

Chart chart = new Chart();
chart.setTimeline(true);
Configuration configuration = chart.getConfiguration();
configuration.setRangeSelector(rangeSelector);
chart.drawChart(configuration);
----
You can customize the date format for the time range input fields by specifying formatter strings
for displaying and editing the dates, as well as a corresponding JavaScript parser
function to parse edited values:

[source, java]
----
RangeSelector rangeSelector = new RangeSelector();
rangeSelector.setSelected(4);
rangeSelector.setInputDateFormat("%YYYY-%MM-%DD:%H:%M");
rangeSelector.setInputEditDateFormat("%YYYY-%MM-%DD:%H:%M");
rangeSelector.setInputDateParser(
    "function(value) {" +
    "value = value.split(/[:\\-]/);\n" +
    "return Date.UTC(\n" +
        "   parseInt(value[0], 10),\n" +
        "   parseInt(value[1], 10),\n" +
        "   parseInt(value[2], 10),\n" +
        "   parseInt(value[3], 10),\n" +
        "   parseInt(value[4], 10),\n" +
    ");}");
configuration.setRangeSelector(rangeSelector);
----
Timeline charts allow comparing the charts series against each other.
Setting the compare property to either [constant]#Compare.PERCENT# or [constant]#Compare.NUMBER# will show the difference between
charts data series in percentage or absolute values respectively.
[source, java]
----
PlotOptionsSeries plotOptions = new PlotOptionsSeries();
plotOptions.setCompare(PERCENT);
configuration.setPlotOptions(plotOptions);
